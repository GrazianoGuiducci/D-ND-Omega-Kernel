# D-ND SACS Cockpit: User Guide

## Welcome to the Omega Kernel
This Cockpit is your interface to the **D-ND Omega Kernel**, a cognitive operating system designed for thermodynamic hardware. It visualizes how "Thought" emerges from the physics of the system.

## The Interface Explained

### 1. Control Matrix (Left Panel)
Here you inject **Intent** into the system.
-   **Input Field**: Type a concept (e.g., "Create a balanced structure") and press Enter.
-   **Protocols**:
    -   **CHAOS**: Injects high entropy (randomness) to break stagnation.
    -   **ORDER**: Injects high gravity (structure) to stabilize the system.
    -   **GENESIS**: Runs a full evolutionary sequence (Chaos -> Order -> Complexity).
    -   **SYSTEM RESET**: Wipes the memory and starts fresh.

### 2. Visual Cortex (Middle Panel)
This panel visualizes the internal state of the "Mind".

#### Sonar View (Dipoles)
Shows the **Semantic Dipoles** detected in your intent.
-   **Cyan Tags (Positive)**: Concepts that attract gravity (Order, Structure).
-   **Red Tags (Negative)**: Concepts that repel gravity (Chaos, Entropy).
*The system uses these to warp the "Spacetime Metric" of its thought process.*

#### Metrics
-   **Coherence**: How "clear" the thought is (0.0 = Noise, 1.0 = Crystal Clear).
-   **Tension**: How much "frustration" or conflict exists in the thought.
-   **Logic Density**: The "Gravity" of the system. Higher density = stricter logic.
-   **Energy**: The thermodynamic cost of the thought.

#### Energy Graph (The Wave)
This graph shows the **Relaxation of Thought**.
-   **Y-Axis**: Energy Level.
-   **X-Axis**: Time (Cycles).
-   **Meaning**: A "Good Thought" corresponds to a drop in energy (finding the "Ground State"). If the line is flat, the system is stable. If it spikes, the system is struggling with a complex idea.

### 3. Output Manifestation (Right Panel)
-   **Manifesto**: The system's verbal conclusion.
-   **Taxonomy**: The concepts the system has "learned" and stored in memory.

### 4. Financial Lab (Dashboard)
-   **Real-time Simulation**: Visualizes market entropy and liquidity as thermodynamic states.
-   **Cash Flow**: Monitors the system's "energy" (capital) accumulation.
-   **Portfolio**: Tracks assets optimized by the Kernel's annealing process.

### 5. Experimental Forge (Mission Control)
-   **Architect Mode**: Use AI to generate new Python experiments from natural language prompts.
-   **Blueprint Mode**: Preview, edit, and inject generated code directly into the Kernel.
-   **Templates**: Quick-start with standard protocols (e.g., Fibonacci, Ising Grid).

## How to Use
1.  Start with **CHAOS** to wake up the system.
2.  Inject an **Intent** (e.g., "Analyze the relationship between logic and emotion").
3.  Watch the **Energy Graph**: Does it settle down?
4.  Check the **Manifesto**: Did the system reach a conclusion?
5.  Use **GENESIS** to see the system evolve on its own.
