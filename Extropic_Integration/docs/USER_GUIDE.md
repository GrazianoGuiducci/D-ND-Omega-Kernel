# D-ND SACS Cockpit: User Guide

## Welcome to the Omega Kernel
This Cockpit is your interface to the **D-ND Omega Kernel**, a cognitive operating system designed for thermodynamic hardware. It visualizes how "Thought" emerges from the physics of the system.

## The Interface Explained

### 1. Control Matrix (Left Panel)
Here you inject **Intent** into the system.
-   **Input Field**: Type a concept (e.g., "Create a balanced structure") and press Enter.
-   **Protocols**:
    -   **CHAOS**: Injects high entropy (randomness) to break stagnation.
    -   **ORDER**: Injects high gravity (structure) to stabilize the system.
    -   **GENESIS**: Runs a full evolutionary sequence (Chaos -> Order -> Complexity).
    -   **SYSTEM RESET**: Wipes the memory and starts fresh.

### 2. Visual Cortex (Middle Panel)
This panel visualizes the internal state of the "Mind".

#### Sonar View (Dipoles)
Shows the **Semantic Dipoles** detected in your intent.
-   **Cyan Tags (Positive)**: Concepts that attract gravity (Order, Structure).
-   **Red Tags (Negative)**: Concepts that repel gravity (Chaos, Entropy).
*The system uses these to warp the "Spacetime Metric" of its thought process.*

#### Metrics
-   **Coherence**: How "clear" the thought is (0.0 = Noise, 1.0 = Crystal Clear).
-   **Tension**: How much "frustration" or conflict exists in the thought.
-   **Logic Density**: The "Gravity" of the system. Higher density = stricter logic.
-   **Energy**: The thermodynamic cost of the thought.

#### Energy Graph (The Wave)
This graph shows the **Relaxation of Thought**.
-   **Y-Axis**: Energy Level.
-   **X-Axis**: Time (Cycles).
-   **Meaning**: A "Good Thought" corresponds to a drop in energy (finding the "Ground State"). If the line is flat, the system is stable. If it spikes, the system is struggling with a complex idea.

### 3. Output Manifestation (Right Panel)
-   **Manifesto**: The system's verbal conclusion.
-   **Taxonomy**: The concepts the system has "learned" and stored in memory.

### 4. Financial Lab (Dashboard)
-   **Real-time Simulation**: Visualizes market entropy and liquidity as thermodynamic states.
-   **Cash Flow**: Monitors the system's "energy" (capital) accumulation.
-   **Portfolio**: Tracks assets optimized by the Kernel's annealing process.

### 5. Experimental Forge (Zero-Shot UI)
The Forge is now a **Hybrid Generative Engine** powered by OpenRouter.
-   **Text-to-Widget**: Type a description (e.g., *"Create a circular progress bar for CPU usage"*) and watch the system build the React component in real-time.
-   **Live Interaction**: Generated widgets are fully functional and interactive.
-   **Persistence**: Any widget you create is automatically saved. When you reload the Cockpit, your custom dashboard is restored exactly as you left it.
-   **Architect Mode**: (Advanced) Use AI to generate Python kinetic experiments.

## How to Use
1.  **Exploration**: Start with **CHAOS** to wake up the system.
2.  **Creation**: Go to the **Forge** tab, click "New Widget", and describe a tool you need. The AI will code it for you.
3.  **Observation**: Watch the **Energy Graph** settle as the Kernel processes your intent.
4.  **Analysis**: Check the **Manifesto** for the "Conclusion" of the cognitive cycle.
